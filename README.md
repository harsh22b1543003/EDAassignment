Boxplot: A boxplot, also known as a box-and-whisker plot, is a graphical representation of the distribution of a dataset. It shows the median, quartiles, and outliers of the data. The box represents the interquartile range (IQR), which is the range between the first and third quartiles. The whiskers extend from the box to the minimum and maximum values within 1.5 times the IQR. Outliers are represented as individual points beyond the whiskers. Boxplots are useful for comparing distributions and identifying outliers in a dataset.

Pairplot: A pairplot is a type of plot that shows pairwise relationships between variables in a dataset. It creates a grid of scatterplots, where each variable is compared to every other variable. The diagonal of the grid usually contains histograms or kernel density estimates (KDEs) of each variable. Pairplots are useful for visualizing correlations between variables and identifying patterns in the data.

Countplot: A countplot is a type of barplot that shows the counts of observations in each category of a categorical variable. It is essentially a histogram for categorical data. Countplots are useful for visualizing the distribution of categorical variables and identifying the most common categories.

Heatmap: A heatmap is a graphical representation of data where values in a matrix are represented as colors. It is often used to visualize the correlation between variables in a dataset. A heatmap is created by assigning a color to each value in the matrix, with higher values represented by warmer colors (e.g., red) and lower values represented by cooler colors (e.g., blue). Heatmaps are useful for identifying patterns and relationships in large datasets.

Barplot: A barplot is a type of plot that shows the relationship between a categorical variable and a numeric variable. It consists of vertical bars, where the height of each bar represents the mean or median value of the numeric variable for each category of the categorical variable. Barplots are useful for comparing the means or medians of different categories and identifying differences between them.
